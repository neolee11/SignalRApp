Hubs protocol:
Base end point is /signalr
Optional: get JS metadata (JS proxies) from /signalr/hubs

Need to know:
1. Groups are not persisted. 
2. Nuget package: Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR

Server side Implementaion details:
1. Grab SignalR from Nuget            
2. add the line below to the Startup.Configuration method
   app.MapSignalR(); 
3. Add hubs on the server side

Client side Implementation 
- jQuery with static proxy file (/signalr/hubs)
1. Get reference to hub (hubs become properties on $.connection)
2. Wire up events
3. Start hub connection
4. Call method
5. Done

- jQuery without proxy file 
1. create hubConnection - Derived from $.connection
2. Get dynamic proxy
3. wire up events based on method/event handler name via on
4. Start & invoke methods based on method name via invoke

- .NET Client (WinRT, WPF, WinForm, Windows Phone App, etc)
1. Create HubConnection
2. Create hub proxy via CreateHubProxy
3. Wire up event handlers via On
4. Start connection with Start
5. Call methods via Invoke


Self Hosting - sits on top of OWIN
1. Define startup class with IAppBuilder method signature
2. Map hubs onto IAppBuilder (route)
3. No automatic scanning of referenced assemblies
